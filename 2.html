    <p>Branding is the process of giving a meaning to <br>
        specific organization, company, products or services <br>
        by creating and shaping a brand in consumers’ minds. <br>
        </p><p>
        It is a strategy designed by organizations to help <br>
        people to quickly identify and experience their brand, <br>
        and give them a reason to choose their products over <br>
        the competition’s, by clarifying what this particular <br>
        brand is and is not.</p>
